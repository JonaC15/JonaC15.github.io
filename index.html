					Welcome

					Hello, my name is Jonathan Carrera. I am a gradute from Columbia State Community College with an associates degree in Computer Information Systems with a concentration in programming. I haved developed websites and programmings using programming languages such as Java, C#, HTML & CSS. As well as created maintained databases using SQL. With every new project I recieve, I see it as a change to gain experience and grow.

					My pervious work experiencea has included jobs like working in construction, where I learned how to work in a team and learned the definition of "hard work". Other jobs I've had is working at Publix grocery store where I learned how to treat each and every one of our customers with excelent customer service. I enjoy working with other to hear other opionions, as well as working with others to get the job at hand done.
